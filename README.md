# DIETEX---Chatbot

To start a good life, healthcare is more important, But it is very difficult to obtain a consultation with a doctor in case of health issues. The proposed idea is to create a care Chabot system using artificial intelligence that can diagnose the disease and provide basic details about the disease before consulting a doctor. The Chabot system provides text/voice assistance to communicate friendly with the bot. This bot will provide which type of disease you suffer from based on your given symptoms and appear doctor details based on the disease you suffer. The Chabot will clarify the user disease with a series of questions and symptoms confirmation will be done. Our technology includes a multilingual Chabot that can handle different languages. By determining the user’s language from the input, our Chabot can handle many languages, switch between them automatically, and respond in the user’s native tongue. Customers may easily communicate with your Chabot in their own language. This application is going to be very helpful to the users as they can easily get medical assistance without paying.
